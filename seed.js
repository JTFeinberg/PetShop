It\'s true! Her quirkiness had me wrapped around her little finger... err..paw. Coco Puff is a little eccentric looking-her antenna ears, long lanky legs, lean body, far set eyes and smirky grin make her look as silly as her personality. Coco loves her toys: she walks around the yard shaking them so hard you\'d think surely she\'s rattled her brains. Once she\'s burned off some steam, she will lay with her paws daintily placed on top of the toy, admiring her treasure. When I showed her a squeaker-just a plain old squeaker, no toy attached, she got so excited I couldn\'t help but give it to her. She laid there, squeaker hanging out of the side of her mouth like a cigar, relishing in her new found loot, not a care in the world. Coco seems housebroken, knows some commands and comes to us spayed and ready for her new home. In spite of her outlandish persona, Coco doesn\'t need anything extraordinary... just some good food, a few toys, and YOU! Ask to meet her today.'}),

When I met her she was very much the lady. She sat calmly (letting her beauty show) while I showered her with those popular chin and cheek rubs and gave her a good but gentle petting. I didn\'t get cheek rubs back but, instead, a steady stream of happy purring! This gal was enjoying herself and me. I wish I could tell you more but it\'s all very simple.

She will not get out of the bed until I actually get up. No need to worry she will get up and wonder the house after bed time. She is perfect addition to a home looking for a cozy companion. She has a great personality, infectious smile and can be a goof when she gets excited. Enjoys bring you her ball, rope or plush toy for a round of tug or fetch indoors.

Do you like to play, too? Nothing makes me happier than spending time with people (or other puppies) but I also enjoy going for walks, chasing after balls and getting into games of tug-o-war because I think toys are just the best. Y\'all brought some toys with you today, right? Phew! I thought we might have to be boring for a moment there but now we can PLAY! And guess what? Not only am I good at sports, I\'m a bit of a scholar too. I can sit on command for treats or to wait for you to throw the ball, though sometimes I just kind of hover my butt so I can run after it that much more quickly, and I\'ll always come when you call. I heard my friends here at the Care Center say I am a good boy and that I \'aced my behavior assessment\' which means I can live in just about any home, yippee! If you\'re looking for a 12 year old puppy to share in all the good food and fun the world has to offer then this puppy is looking for you.
