Coco loves her toys: she walks around the yard shaking them so hard you\'d think surely she\'s rattled her brains. Once she\'s burned off some steam, she will lay with her paws daintily placed on top of the toy, admiring her treasure. When I showed her a squeaker-just a plain old squeaker, no toy attached, she got so excited I couldn\'t help but give it to her. She laid there, squeaker hanging out of the side of her mouth like a cigar, relishing in her new found loot, not a care in the world. Coco seems housebroken, knows some commands and comes to us spayed and ready for her new home.
