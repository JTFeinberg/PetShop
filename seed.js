She laid there, squeaker hanging out of the side of her mouth like a cigar, relishing in her new found loot, not a care in the world.

His former human taught him how to \"sit\", but even cooler--\"lift\", so he can get untangled from his leash when it happens. Well played! And for a big dog, I braced myself for a sleigh ride...that never happened. He moves so lightly and easily on the leash. He is house trained and despite some silver hairs among the gold, a most youthful senior, with great spirit and energy. No need to go to JFK and deal with airport traffic to take a Jet; come to the Adoption Center!'}),

Neil (the first man on the moon), and Lance (one of the greatest athletes in our time), are the most famous Armstrong\'s we know. The name carries alot of weight, so this dog must be special to have been named, Armstrong. I happen to think so. He is quit handsome, but it\'s his personality that makes him a real charmer. Soft and uber friendly, he\'ll wiggle his way into the history books. He has a tendency to get a little too excited but nothing a little training can\'t fix.'}),

He\'s an adult male, said to be house trained, and a bit on the fuller figured tip. But hey, that\'s more to love. And easy to leash, walking at a pleasant pace. Nabisco is a very affectionate, people-centric dog, relishing all kinds of strokes, ear scratches, cuddles, so would likely welcome a family to love. More people, more love opportunities! Nabisco enjoyed treats (yes he did!) and enthusiastically showed off crackerjack \"sit\" skills. Dogs that arrived and departed in the adjoining pen received friendly interest at the gate, so Nabisco seems okay with male and female dogs. The backyard hose seemed to cause him some concern, and he needed cookies and gentle coaxing to get past it. (Oreo cookies get me past a lot, too, so I get it.) With his love sponge style, and sweet ways, Nabisco is welcome addition to any household with an average amount of dog owning experience.'}),
